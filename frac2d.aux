the lithologies and their thickness in the column are entered from the bottom of the column upwards. the compositions 
are assumed to be in molar units and the order of the components must be identical to the order specified in the 
computational option file. the compositional data is automatically renormalized so that the representative mass is 1 kg

model the instantaeneous flux of a component is ~mass/rho*zbox
