1) 687: redop1/meemum set iopt(6) = 0, prevents setau1 from using arf data?

2) yclos1 has set soltol to 1 in 687? reset to nopt(8) in 688.

3) 688 eliminates clib.f, dlib.f, getxz1.f, dumlib.f files from make.

4) 687 bugs:
   a) inconsistent commons cxt12, cxt10, cst7
   b) double output of time stamp
   c) in gphase gfes called with y(1) rather than y(2)
   d) call to moduli may reset p0a in getphp prior to call to ginc?

5) csol and getscp are largely redundant, csol assumes p0a has been set to account
   for decomposition of ordered species, whereas getscp does the decomposition with
   getpp.

6) getpp is redundant with p0dord? y2p0 should be used if a prior call to getscp/csol
   may have changed p0 (as in moduli or getcmp).
