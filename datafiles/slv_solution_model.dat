                             Solution model type flags are:

                             0  - internal (fluid) EoS
                             1  - simple microscopic formulation (described in terms of bragg-williams fractions)
                             2  - simple macroscopic formulation (described in terms of endmember fractions)
                             6  - macroscopic formulation with speciation.
                             7  - macroscopic formulation reciprocal solution with dependent endmembers.
                             8  - macroscopic formulation reciprocal solution with dependent endmembers and speciation.

                             Special models:

                             23 - Toops-Samis melt model
                             24 - Holland & Powell Haplogranite melt model 
                             25 - Ghirso pMELTS/MELTS model
                             26 - Haefner H2O-CO2-NaCl
                             27 - Silicate vapor (ideal)
                             28 - High T silicate melt

                             For non-ideal solutions, microscopic models assume Margules type excess functions; 
                             macroscopic models may be posed in terms of Margules (See model "Bio(HP)" for a commented
                             example) or Van Laar (e.g., Holland and Powell, CMP 2003; See model Fsp(C1) for a commented 
                             example) excess functions. The format of model type 1 is described in detail in the Perple_X 
                             program documentation (vdoc.pdf).
                           
                             The format for all other model types is not yet documented, but may be deduced from the commentary
                             within the models included herein. Character data is format free in all models except model type 1.

                             comments can be placed between models provided, nothing is written in the first 10 columns. Comments 
                             may be placed after data if it is separated from the data by a '|' marker.

                                      WARNING 1: This model can only be used for hydrous systems

                                      staurated component, it CANNOT be used if water is specified
                                      as a saturated phase component (i.e., if H2O is specified as a saturated 
                                      phase component, VERTEX will reject the H2OL endmember
                                      and the model will be applicable only to dry melts).

                                      this model uses an internal routine to compute the

                                      to the fo8L, fa8L, and sil8L enedmembers make the

                                      Ghiorso et al (2002) G3 v. 3 (n. 5) model for mantle
                                      melting, 1-3 GPa. Read cautionary notes in Ghirso for
                                      applications beyond this pressure range. Calculations
                                      with this model can be sped up significantly by restricting
                                      the subdivsion ranges specified below.

                                      This is a reduced version of the pMELTS model that excludes
                                      the Cr-, Ni-, Co-, and P-bearing melt components. The melt
                                      endmember names have been changed from those used in the pMELTS paper.

                                      This model should be applied with solid phase data 
                                      and solution models from the MELTS program. The melt
                                      endmember data converted to PERPLE_X format is in the 
                                      file pMELTSver.dat. The PERPLE_X solid phase data files
                                      b92ver.dat and hp98ver.dat also include this data and therefore
                                      can be used with the pMELTS model, however using these files 
                                      will almost certainly result in inconsistencies with published
                                      pMELTS results.

                                      WARNING 1: This model can only be used for hydrous systems  
                                      if H2O is specified as a thermodynamic component
                                      (i.e., if H2O is specified as a saturated 
                                      component, VERTEX will reject the h2oG(L) endmember
                                      and the model will be applicable only to dry melts).

                                      WARNING 2: this model uses an internal routine to 
                                      compute the entropy of the melt that assumes 
                                      h2oG(l) is the first endmember.

                                      WARNING 3: the subdivision ranges below may not
                                      span the entire range of validity for the pMELT
                                      model. Check these ranges, and adjust them as 
                                      necessary before using this model.

                                      Modified to use pure water at P and T standard
                                      state (the H2O endmember) as opposed to the h2oGL 
                                      endmember of Ghiorso et al. (2003), which so far 
                                      as I understand should  be equivalent. 

                                      NOTE: Use of H2O as an endmember requires the user
                                      specify an equation of state for H2O when running
                                      BUILD. To be strictly consistent with Ghiorso et al
                                      the Sterner and Pitzer EoS for water should be used 
                                      for this purpose, but it is not presently included
                                      in perplex. Instead of the Sterner-Pitzer EoS i would
                                      recommend using the CORK EoS, which differs negligibly
                                      from the Sterner-Pitzer EoS.
